# tb_uncertainty
 Python code used to generate uncertainty analyses for the modelling of tuberculosis using ODE-based models.

 The ODE_based models are developed using the summer package (https://github.com/monash-emu/summer2).
 Model calibration is performed using the estival package (https://github.com/monash-emu/estival).
